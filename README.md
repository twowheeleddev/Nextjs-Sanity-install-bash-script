# ISSUES - when the script is complete it actually makes the nextjs-layer-cake dir inside the Client directory. I need to fix this but for lack of time I am moving on to other things. 
check the Server directory for the same issue.

# make sure to 'chmod +x ./setup.sh'
## now just run the command by using './setup.sh'
## once the script completes cd into the server folder and run 'sanity init'
